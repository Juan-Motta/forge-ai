# codeforge installer — copy the workflow discipline into a target project.
#
#   ./install.sh [target-dir] [--upgrade] [--with-hooks] [--git-init] [--no-isolate]
#
# With no target-dir, installs into the current working directory. So the common flow is:
#   cd my-project && /path/to/codeforge/install.sh
#
# THIN INSTALL: the target receives only what the agent needs at RUNTIME. All framework
# machinery (the neutral source in ./src/, the generators sync.sh/ps1, the generation
# inputs in configs/, and the seed templates) stays in the codeforge repo — never copied
# into the target. To customize or upgrade, edit the codeforge source and re-run this
# installer against the target (`--upgrade`, or a bare re-run from inside the project).
#
# The shippable payload is the NEUTRAL source in ./src/ (CLAUDE.md, skills/, shared/,
# configs/, docs/, *.template.md). This installer copies the runtime subset into the
# target, then runs `sync.sh --out <target>` to GENERATE each engine's config + skills
# (.claude/ + .agents/skills + .codex/config.toml + AGENTS.md + opencode.json) straight
# into the target. No symlinks (Windows-safe). The generated engine artifacts are COMMITTED
# with the target project so a fresh clone works immediately — no codeforge dependency at
# runtime; re-run the installer after editing the source to regenerate.
#
# LANDS IN THE TARGET (runtime only):
#   CLAUDE.md, AGENTS.md, opencode.json, .claude/, .agents/, .codex/ (generated),
#   shared/rules/*.md + shared/state.template.md + shared/scripts/* (managed), docs/ scaffolding + CHANGELOG,
#   PROJECT.md + CONTINUITY.md (project-owned, seeded if missing).
# STAYS IN codeforge (never copied): src/skills (neutral), configs/, sync.sh, sync.ps1,
#   *.template.md, docs/extending.md.
#
# MANAGED (framework baseline — OVERWRITTEN on install/upgrade): CLAUDE.md, the framework's
#   OWN entries in shared/rules/, shared/state.template.md. Your own rules dropped into
#   shared/rules/ survive upgrades (selective, per-entry by name).
# PROJECT-OWNED (created only if missing — NEVER clobbered): PROJECT.md, CONTINUITY.md,
#   docs/CHANGELOG.md. Per-project Claude overrides go in .claude/settings.local.json.
