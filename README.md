# forge-ai

**One workflow discipline that runs identically on Claude Code, Codex, and OpenCode.**

forge-ai gives an AI coding agent a consistent, opinionated way of working — research →
plan → TDD → cross-engine review → verify → ship — plus shared memory and session
continuity. The discipline is **skills + config only** — no runtime hooks or scripts (the
one-time installer is the only script). Point any of the three CLIs at the project and
they pick up the same rules, the same skills, and the same guardrails.

---

## What it does

- **Interoperable discipline.** The same workflow works whether you drive with Claude
  Code, Codex, or OpenCode — no per-engine fork to maintain.
- **Guided workflows** for the common cases: new feature, bug fix, quick fix, PRD,
  research, planning, review, multi-engine council, and branch wrap-up.
- **Cross-engine review.** The reviewer/advisor always runs on a *different* engine than
  the driver, so you get real model diversity, not an echo chamber.
- **Portable memory + docs layout.** Solved bugs, decisions (ADRs), plans, and research
  live in the repo so the next session — or the next engine — inherits the context.
- **Session continuity.** A tiny handoff file lets a fresh session (or a reset context)
  resume exactly where you left off.
- **Native ship guardrails.** `git push` / `gh pr create` pause for human approval on
  each engine, using its own native config — no custom scripts.

## How it works

### One canonical source, three engines

There is a single copy of the instructions and skills. Each engine discovers them through
its own conventional path — via symlinks — so nothing is duplicated.

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    subgraph SRC["Single canonical source"]
        INS["CLAUDE.md<br/>(AGENTS.md is a symlink to it)"]
        SK["skills/&lt;name&gt;/SKILL.md"]
        RU["shared/rules/*.md"]
    end
    SRC --> CLAUDE["Claude Code<br/>reads CLAUDE.md<br/>.claude/skills → skills"]
    SRC --> CODEX["Codex<br/>reads AGENTS.md<br/>.codex/skills → skills"]
    SRC --> OPEN["OpenCode<br/>reads AGENTS.md<br/>.opencode/skills → skills"]
```

- **Instructions:** `CLAUDE.md` is the canonical always-on instruction set. `AGENTS.md` is
  a symlink to it. Claude Code reads `CLAUDE.md`; Codex and OpenCode read `AGENTS.md`. One
  file, no drift, all three auto-load it at session start.
- **Skills:** the `SKILL.md` convention is shared by all three engines. The canonical
  `skills/` folder is symlinked into each engine's discovery path
  (`.claude/skills`, `.codex/skills`, `.opencode/skills`).
- **Rules:** `shared/rules/*.md` hold the discipline (severity, TDD, ship-gates, memory,
  continuity, models, …), referenced by the skills.

### Enforcement model — advisory + native approval

There is **no hook** that conditionally blocks an action. The skills *instruct* the agent
to pass the gates before shipping (advisory), and on top of that each engine applies a
**coarse native approval** on outward actions:

| Engine | Native gate | Config |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Claude Code | `git push` / `gh pr create` are `ask`-tier | `.claude/settings.json` |
| Codex | approval required before non-trivial shell commands | `.codex/config.toml` |
| OpenCode | `git push*` / `gh pr create*` set to `ask` (force-push `deny`) | `opencode.json` |

The human approving the prompt is the backstop: **don't approve a push/PR whose gates
aren't green.** (Hard conditional blocking would require per-engine hooks — deliberately
out of scope; see [`docs/extending.md`](docs/extending.md).)

## The workflow

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    prd["prd<br/>(what/why)"] --> research["research<br/>(sourced brief)"]
    research --> plan["plan<br/>(compare + choose)"]
    plan --> build["new-feature / fix-bug<br/>TDD + cross-engine review"]
    build --> finish["finish-branch<br/>verify → commit → push/PR"]
    review["review / council"] -.consulted by.-> plan
    review -.consulted by.-> build
    checkpoint["checkpoint"] -.writes.-> CONT["CONTINUITY.md"]
    CONT -.resumed at session start.-> prd
```

### Skills

| Skill | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `prd` | Capture problem/users/goals before designing → `docs/prds/` |
| `research` | Check current docs + prior art, write a sourced brief → `docs/research/` |
| `plan` | Clarify intent, compare approaches, write a reviewed plan → `docs/plans/` |
| `new-feature` | Full feature flow: research → plan → review → TDD → review → verify → ship |
| `fix-bug` | Systematic debugging: reproduce → root cause → failing test → fix → ship |
| `quick-fix` | Trivial changes (<3 files); escalates if scope grows |
| `review` | Cross-engine second opinion on a plan or diff (P0–P3 findings) |
| `council` | Multi-engine advisors → verdict + minority report (hard, expensive forks) |
| `finish-branch` | Confirm gates → final verify → commit → push → PR |
| `checkpoint` | Write a clean session handoff to `CONTINUITY.md` before closing |

### Memory & continuity

- **Portable memory (repo-first):** durable knowledge lives in the repo — solved bugs in
  `docs/solutions/`, decisions in `docs/adr/`, history in `docs/CHANGELOG.md` — because
  all three engines read it. Personal per-engine memory is used only where it exists.
- **Continuity:** `CONTINUITY.md` holds the current focus, the single **Next step**, and
  blockers. Golden rule #1 tells the agent to read it first every session, so a new
  session or a reset context resumes correctly.

### Models (cross-engine roles)

Defaults live in `shared/rules/models.md` (edit there to change them). The reviewer/advisor
always runs on a **different engine than the driver**:

| Engine | Model | Effort |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Codex | `gpt-5.6-sol` | `xhigh` |
| Claude | `opus` | `high` |
| OpenCode | `opencode-go/glm-5.2` | default |

`council` consults all three at once; `review`/`research` use the non-driver engine.

## Installation

forge-ai is the framework repo — install its discipline into a target project. It's
**copy-based**, so the discipline travels with that repo (works on any clone, no external
dependency):

```bash
./install.sh /path/to/your-project              # first install
./install.sh /path/to/your-project --upgrade    # refresh framework files later
```

What it does:

- **Copies the managed baseline** (overwritten on upgrade): `CLAUDE.md`, `skills/`,
  `shared/rules/`, `docs/extending.md`, the `*.template.md` files, and the docs scaffolding
  — then creates the symlinks (`AGENTS.md`, `.claude/skills`, `.codex/skills`,
  `.opencode/skills`).
- **Creates project-owned files only if missing** (never clobbered on re-run): `PROJECT.md`,
  `CONTINUITY.md`, `.claude/settings.json`, `.codex/config.toml`, `opencode.json`.
- An existing `CLAUDE.md` is backed up to `CLAUDE.md.pre-forge.bak` (move its
  project-specifics into `PROJECT.md`), and `.gitignore` is merged, not replaced.

Then fill in `PROJECT.md` and open the project in any of the three engines.

## How to use it

### 1. Open the project in any engine

- **Claude Code** — open the folder; `CLAUDE.md` and `.claude/skills/` load automatically.
- **Codex** — open the folder; `AGENTS.md` and `.codex/skills/` load automatically. Trust
  the project when prompted.
- **OpenCode** — open the folder; `AGENTS.md` and the skills load automatically;
  `opencode.json` applies the push/PR approval gate.

At session start the agent reads `CONTINUITY.md` and resumes from its **Next step**.

### 2. Run a workflow

Skills load **on demand** — there's no special slash syntax (these are `SKILL.md` skills,
not slash-commands). Two ways to trigger one, the same across all three engines:

- **Implicitly** — just describe the task; the engine matches it to a skill's
  `description` and loads it (e.g. "add a feature that …" → `new-feature`; "there's a bug
  where …" → `fix-bug`).
- **Explicitly** — name it: *"use the `new-feature` skill"*, *"run `council` on whether to
  do A or B"*, *"`checkpoint` before I stop"*.

Per engine, if you want to confirm what's available: ask *"what skills do you have in this
project?"* — all three list the `skills/` folder. The skill then walks its phases, writes
artifacts to the right `docs/` folder, and tracks progress in `.workflow/state.md`.

### 3. Ship behind the gate

Before shipping, the workflow checks that the `.workflow/state.md` gates are green
(branch, plan reviewed, tests passing, review clean, verified). `git push` / `gh pr create`
then prompt for approval — approve only when the gates are green.

### 4. Close a session cleanly

Run **`checkpoint`** before you stop (or when context gets tight). It writes a concrete
handoff to `CONTINUITY.md` so the next session — same engine or different — picks up
exactly where you left off.

## Project-specific rules

Two rule layers apply, both always-on:

- **Global baseline** (`CLAUDE.md` golden rules + `shared/rules/*`) — the framework
  discipline, applies without exception.
- **Project rules** (`PROJECT.md`) — this project's **Persona**, **Project info**,
  **Variables**, and **Special rules**. Editable per project.

Project rules **add and refine** (tone, context, variables, special behavior); they never
override the safety/ship-gate baseline (on conflict, the baseline wins). All three engines
load `PROJECT.md` via golden rule #2 (OpenCode also force-loads it via `opencode.json`
`instructions`).

**To add project rules:** copy `PROJECT.template.md` → `PROJECT.md`, fill the four
sections, commit. No per-engine config needed. See `shared/rules/project-rules.md`.

## Extending

See [`docs/extending.md`](docs/extending.md) — it defines three tiers (skills-only,
skills + invoked scripts, hooks), a decision checklist, and the steps to add a new skill.
Most new functionality is a single `skills/<name>/SKILL.md` that all three engines
discover automatically.

## Status

Skeleton (2026-07-15). Engines: Claude Code, Codex, OpenCode. 10 skills, 10 rules.
Live-validated: instruction + skill discovery and `council` work across all three engines.
Pending: interactive test of the native push/PR gate.
