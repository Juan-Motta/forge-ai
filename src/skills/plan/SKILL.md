description: Turn an idea into a reviewed design — clarify intent, compare 2–3 approaches on fixed axes, pick one with rationale, and write a plan the implementation follows. Use before building a non-trivial change under Claude Code, Codex, or OpenCode. Feeds new-feature / fix-bug.

# plan

Design before you build. Produces a written plan that `new-feature` / `fix-bug`
implements against. Pairs with `research` (run it first when external tech is involved).

## 1. Clarify intent

Pin down purpose, constraints, and success criteria. Ask the user one question at a time
only when something is genuinely ambiguous; otherwise state your assumptions and proceed.
Do not write implementation code in this phase.

## 2. Compare approaches

List **2–3 genuinely different** approaches and score them on the fixed axes in
`shared/rules/approach-comparison.md` (complexity, blast radius, reversibility, time to
validate, correctness/user risk). Name the default winner and why — prefer the simplest
option that clears the bar.

## 3. Validate the choice (don't self-certify)

Run `review` or `council` on the chosen approach before locking it in. If the cheapest
falsifying experiment is quick, spike it first and let evidence decide. Resolve any
P0/P1/P2 the reviewer raises (`shared/rules/severity.md`).

## 4. Write the plan

Capture: the goal, the chosen approach + the comparison table, the files/units to touch,
edge cases, the tests that will prove it (TDD — `shared/rules/tdd.md`), and acceptance
criteria. Keep units small and single-purpose. Save to `docs/plans/<feature>.md`
(`shared/rules/docs-layout.md`) and reference it from `.workflow/state.md`. Record any
significant architecture decision as an ADR in `docs/adr/`.

## 5. Hand off to implementation

`new-feature` / `fix-bug` build from this plan. A gap here propagates downstream, so a
missing required behavior or acceptance criterion is a P1, not a nit.

## Verification

The plan states the goal, a compared-and-chosen approach (with rationale), the test plan,
and acceptance criteria; the choice was reviewed by another engine. Missing any of these
means it's not ready to implement.
